Planetary Annihilation: 4K GUI Scale

Increases the maximum possible GUI scale setting value within Settings > Gameplay.

Since this brings with it the possibility of setting the scale too high and losing visibility of the settings save
button, a "Reset Scale" button is shown after changing the scale to the left of the existing GUI Scale slider to
immediately set to a lower setting.
